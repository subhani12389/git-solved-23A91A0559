## Quick Start - Advanced Mode
```bash
# Install AI dependencies
pip install tensorflow keras

# Initialize AI models
./scripts/init-ai-models.sh

# Start with AI-enhanced mode
npm run start:ai
```

## Quick Start - Standard Mode
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure environment variables
3. Run deployment script with `--experimental` flag
4. Monitor system through AI dashboard

## AI Integration
Our system now uses machine learning to:
- Predict optimal deployment times
- Auto-scale based on predicted load
- Detect anomalies before they cause issues
- Suggest configuration improvements

## Documentation
See `/docs` folder and `/docs/ai-integration.md`
